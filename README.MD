In version 2, the project is being refactored and the principles of OOP are being applied.


This project pulls down a tweet every hour involving the word tweet. It is then saved in the tweet datalake (an s3 bucket), then the most recent tweet is written to the database. The most recent tweet written to the database is then posted on the website sandwich.xyz.

The development was mostly done in a linux ec2 instance.
